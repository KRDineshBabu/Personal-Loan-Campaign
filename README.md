# Personal Loan Campaign
1.	Project Objective: 
The data was collected from a personal loams campaign executed by MyBank. Total of 20,000 customers were targets with an offer of personal loans at 10% interested rate. The customers responded for the personal loan are labelled as target = 1 and remaining are labeled as target =0.   
The objective of the project is to design the decision tree model (CART and random forest) to predict the respondent and non-respondent for the personal loan.

2.	Project Approach:
    - Data exploration 
    - Multi-collinearity of the variables 
    - Remove highly correlated variables 
    - Decision tree
    - CART 
      	+ Over sampling 
        + Under Sampling 
        + Combination of over and under sampling
        + ROSE sampling method 
    -	Random Forest 
        + Tuning 
        + Cross validation method 

3.	Data Exploration: 
A Typical Data exploration activity consists of the following steps: 
1.	Install necessary Packages and Invoke Libraries 
2.	Set up working Directory & Import the Dataset 
3.	Data Exploration and Multicollinearity 
4.	KMO analysis 
5.	Identify the important variables
