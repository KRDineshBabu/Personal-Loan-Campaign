# Personal Loan Campaign
Project Objective: 
The data was collected from a personal loams campaign executed by MyBank. Total of 20,000 customers were targets with an offer of personal loans at 10% interested rate. The customers responded for the personal loan are labelled as target = 1 and remaining are labeled as target =0.   

The objective of the project is to design the decision tree model (CART and random forest) to predict the respondent and non-respondent for the personal loan.

Project Approach:

    - Data exploration 
    
    - Multi-collinearity of the variables 
    
    - Remove highly correlated variables 
    
    - Decision tree
    
    - CART 
    
      	+ Over sampling 
      	
        + Under Sampling 
        
        + Combination of over and under sampling
        
        + ROSE sampling method 
        
    -	Random Forest
    
        + Tuning 
        
        + Cross validation method 
        
    - Ensemble method
